    upgrade_psstore.c

DESCRIPTION

    Implementation of an interface to Persistent Storage to get
    details of the file system and anything else related to the
    possibilities of upgrade.

NOTES
    Errors. Cause panics. End of. This behaviour in itself is problematic
            but if we are trying to switch applications then an error
            should indicate a reason to restart. We can't really
            delegate this to the VM app. We can't wind back to a previous
            application.
    Caching. Persistent store keys are not cached. There isn't a mechanism
            to subscribe to PSKEY changes. Since we don't actually expect
            to be called that frequently it makes sense to access the keys
            we need when we need them.

/* details for accessing and storing the FSTAB from persistent store.
 *
 * we expect the FSTAB to consist of
 *      Entry 0 - partition for app to run on boot
 *      Entry ... - Other partitions
 *
 * The rest of the contents are not considered at present and
 * differences beyond the two application entries are ignored as they are
 * not important to upgrade. This would also allow for the application
 * revising the FS in future, by changing its size.
 *
 * As of writing, there is an issue with including the partition
 * to be used to store the upgraded app in the FSTAB. During boot all
 * partitions get mounted before checking if they are executable.
 * However, a mounted partition cannot be opened for writing, thus
 * blocking us from using any partition listed in the FSTAB for
 * storing the upgraded app in.
 *
 * So for now we workaround this by saying that the two app partitions
 * are "1001" and "1002" (SQIF partitions 1 and 2). The code below flips
 * the value of entry 0 in FSTAB to one or the other depending on which
 * partition the app is to be run from. This leaves the other partition
 * un-mounted and available for writing.
