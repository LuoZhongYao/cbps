**
The Stream API provides functions for efficiently processing streams of eight bit data.
Available streams include RFCOMM, L2CAP, the serial port, USB endpoints and files.
**
Streams are classified into sources (which can be read) and sinks (which can be written).

  StreamConnect(), in order to efficiently transfer the data without
  having to copy it.

  long enough for the stream operation to complete, i.e., long enough
  for the source to be read. The source created using this function
  only exists while the data is being read. However, the memory block
  being treated as a source is not freed by the stream subsystem once
  the data has been read. It remains the caller's responsibility to
  manage the memory and free it when it is appropriate to do so.
